# THIS REPO HAS BEEN ARCHIVED AND MOVED TO [CODEBERG](https://codeberg.org/mttaggart/bluebpf)

# BlueBPF

A set of [eBPF](https://ebpf.io) scripts and utilities intended for use in threat hunting and incident response.

## Rationale

I'm a big believer in the power of eBPF for security applications, but I feel that the technology is largely misunderstood and inaccessible. These scripts and associated explainers are an attempt to bridge that gap.

## Setup

You will need [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) and [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/) installed for the BPFTrace and Python tools to work.
